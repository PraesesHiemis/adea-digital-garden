Rover is currently one of the largest and most economically successful cities in the world. There are many reasons for this but some of the biggest are: The good trading lines, favourable climate and good access to precious metals and minerals. Today there are over 100 000 people that call Rover their home. 

The infrastructure in Rover has implemented a vast use of metal. Anything from street torches to fences and railings are often made of or adorned by metals. It has become a status element both on a national and personal level. The city likes to display precious metals in mundane places as a showing of it's wealth, so to do the nobles and aristocrats.

The main housing structure in the city consists of apartment buildings. Most of which have 2 or 3 floors but there are some that have upwards of 5. A bit northeast of the centermost point in the city a 12 story skyscraper stretches upwards, overlooking the rest of the city. It's called The Monolith and it stands as the tallest building in the city. It is made mostly of stone and a dark grey metal. Much of the city shares this colour scheme. Blacks, greys as well as dark blues and reds.  

The harbour is one of the most active parts of the city. Since Rover has well established trading lines with other nations there are often plenty of fishermen and traders who stay the night. You're likely to see a new face in the harbour area every day.

Strict laws and harsh punishments makes crime rates quite low compared to other cities. But crime is by no means eradicated. There are large underground gangs that are skilled enough to remain under the radar of the cityâ€™s Sentinels and Investigators alike.
